# Brain-MRI-Segmentation


# Problem
The task is classify the image i.e. have tumor or not.Then if there is a tumor, segment that part of tumor

# Approach
For classification used the transfer learning model and for segmentation used the ResUNet Architecture

# Flask Demo
Made a flask app for testing the model in google colab.Below is the demo of the web app
